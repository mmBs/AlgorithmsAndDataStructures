Algorithms and Data Structures
===========================

The reason of this project is to memorize algorithms which were required during an Algorithm Course at my university. 

Currently, there are 2 algorithms' implementations:

1. [Bellman - Ford algorithm](https://github.com/mmBs/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/tree/master/BellmanFordAlgorithm)
2. [Monte Carlo algorithm which counts the Pi number](https://github.com/mmBs/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/tree/master/MonteCarloAlgorithmPi)
