Algorithms and Data Structures
===========================

The reason of this project is to memorize algorithms which were required during an Algorithm Course at my university. 

Currenty there are 2 algorithms' implementations:

1. [Bellman - Ford Algorithm](https://github.com/mmBs/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/tree/master/BellmanFordAlgorithm)
2. Monte Carlo Algorithm which counts the Pi number.
